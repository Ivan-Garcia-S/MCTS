- Analysis -

From all the test cases, it seems that the vanilla version has more tree nodes within the time frame. Modified versions tend to have a smaller tree unless it's winning. 

I think it's because we added a lot of procedures in the modified version that increased the runtime, therefore it's slower in creating nodes comparing to the vanilla version.

The result didn't change at various time limits.
