- Analysis - 

In our test results the modified version does in fact win more games every time over the vanilla.  With more nodes it seems that the winrate steadies out more even though the amount of wins the modified wins over the vanilla isn't very much.  The modified seems to perform better when there's a smaller search tree.  I think this is because although playing on a corner space or center space is generally a better move, doing it too often will make it harder to win games because there may be instances where playing on one of the other spaces will make a three-in-a-row.
