Experiment 2 â€“ Heuristic Improvement
Next, have your modified version of MCTS play against the vanilla version with both having equal tree sizes (suggested size: 1000). Submission analysis: Does the modified version win more games? Does this change if you increase or decrease the size of the trees?
