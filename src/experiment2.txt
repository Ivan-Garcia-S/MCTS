Experiment 2 – Heuristic Improvement
Next, have your modified version of MCTS play against the vanilla version with both having equal tree sizes (suggested size: 1000). Submission analysis: Does the modified version win more games? Does this change if you increase or decrease the size of the trees?

- Analysis - 

In our test results the modified version does in fact win more games every time over the vanilla.  With more nodes it seems that 
the winrate steadies out more even though the amount of wins the modified wins over the vanilla isn't very much.  The modified 
seems to perform better when there's a smaller search tree.  I think this is because although playing on a corner space or center 
space is generally a better move, doing it too often will make it harder to win games because there may be instances where playing 
on one of the other spaces will make a three-in-a-row.
